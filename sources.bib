abstract="Today's business enterprises must deal with global competition, reduce the cost of doing business, and rapidly develop new services and products. To address these requirements enterprises must constantly reconsider and optimize the way they do business and change their information systems and applications to support evolving business processes. Workflow technology facilitates these by providing methodologies and software to support (i) business process modeling to capture business processes as workflow specifications, (ii) business process reengineering to optimize specified processes, and (iii) workflow automation to generate workflow implementations from workflow specifications. This paper provides a high-level overview of the current workflow management methodologies and software products. In addition, we discuss the infrastructure technologies that can address the limitations of current commercial workflow technology and extend the scope and mission of workflow management systems to support increased workflow automation in complex real-world environments involving heterogeneous, autonomous, and distributed information systems. In particular, we discuss how distributed object management and customized transaction management can support further advances in the commercial state of the art in this area.",

abstract = {WHAT: Herein is described an experimental Office Information System designed and built at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center to allow multi-computer experiments in distribution and sharing of control within an office environment. WHY: Current office systems go a long way toward aiding the individual user to transact his/her personal office work. Future office information systems need to aid tightly coupled communities of users. Thus, this investigation into communal computing systems is motivated. HOW: Using the Alto/Dorado machines, and the Cedar database and programming environment, we have devised a system which allows the flexible manipulation of electronic forms on the display screen of users and helps to coordinate and control the flow of forms between user workstations. Novel facilities implemented in the system include distributed schedulers, dispatchers, office observer workstations, alerters, a data dictionary synthesizer, change agents, and on-line office modeling, simulation and design facilities.},

This information is used to attribute timing such as queue times to the discovered workflow model. The approach is based on Petri nets and timing information is attached to places. This paper also presents our workflow-mining tool EMiT. This tool translates the workflow log of several commercial systems (e.g., Staffware) to an independent XML format. Based on this format the tool mines for causal relations and produces a graphical workflow model expressed in terms of Petri nets.},

abstract = {Differences in features supported by the various contemporary commercial workflow management systems point to different insights of suitability and different levels of expressive power. The challenge, which we undertake in this paper, is to systematically address workflow requirements, from basic to complex. Many of the more complex requirements identified, recur quite frequently in the analysis phases of workflow projects, however their implementation is uncertain in current products. Requirements for workflow languages are indicated through workflow patterns. In this context, patterns address business requirements in an imperative workflow style expression, but are removed from specific workflow languages. The paper describes a number of workflow patterns addressing what we believe identify comprehensive workflow functionality. These patterns provide the basis for an in-depth comparison of a number of commercially available workflow management systems. As such, this paper can be seen as the academic response to evaluations made by prestigious consulting companies. Typically, these evaluations hardly consider the workflow modeling language and routing capabilities, and focus more on the purely technical and commercial aspects.},

@article{Dijkstra2003ControlPatterns,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We present evidence that resonance properties of rat vibrissae differentially amplify high-frequency and complex tactile signals. Consistent with a model of vibrissa mechanics, optical measurements of vibrissae revealed that their first mechanical resonance frequencies systematically varied from low (60-100 Hz) in longer, posterior vibrissae to high approximately 750 Hz) in shorter, anterior vibrissae. Resonance amplification of tactile input was observed in vivo and ex vivo, and in a variety of boundary conditions that are likely to occur during perception, including stimulation of the vibrissa with moving complex natural stimuli such as sandpaper. Vibrissae were underdamped, allowing for sharp tuning to resonance frequencies. Vibrissa resonance constitutes a potentially useful mechanism for perception of high-frequency and complex tactile signals. Amplification of small amplitude signals by resonance could facilitate detection of stimuli that would otherwise fail to drive neural activity. The systematic map of frequency sensitivity across the face could facilitate texture discrimination through somatotopic encoding of frequency content. These findings suggest strong parallels between vibrissa tactile processing and auditory encoding, in which the cochlea also uses resonance to amplify low-amplitude signals and to generate a spatial map of frequency sensitivity},

@article{Russell2005ResourcePatterns,
abstract = {In the main, the attention of workflow researchers and workflow developers has focussed on the process perspective, i.e., control-flow. As a result, issues associated with the resource perspective, i.e., the people and machines actually doing the work, have been largely neglected. Although the process perspective is of most significance, appropriate consideration of the resource perspective is essential for successful implementation of workflow technology. Previous work has identified recurring, generic constructs in the control-flow and data perspectives, and presented them in the form of control-flow and data patterns. The next logical step is to describe workflow resource patterns that capture the various ways in which resources are represented and utilised in workflows. These patterns include a number of distinct groupings such as push patterns ( the system pushes work to a worker ) and pull patterns ( the worker pulls work from the system ) to describe the many ways in which work can be distributed. By delineating these patterns in a form that is independent of specific workflow technologies and modelling languages, we are able to provide a comprehensive treatment of the resource perspective and we subsequently use these patterns as the basis for a detailed comparison of a number of commercially available workflow management systems.

ProM6 has been developed from scratch and uses a completely redesigned architecture.

abstract = {The deployment ofWorkflow Management systems is a time- consuming and error-prone task. A possible solution is process min- ing, which automatically extracts workflow models from event-data logs. However, the current research in process mining still has problems in mining some common constructs in workflow models. Among these con- structs are short loops, which are loops of length one and two. For in- stance, the $\alpha$-algorithm was proven to mine sound Structured Workflow nets without short loops. In this paper, we present a new algorithm (the $\alpha$+-algorithm) that can handle short loops, and we prove that it correctly mines all sound Structured Workflow nets. The $\alpha$+-algorithm is based on the $\alpha$-algorithm and is implemented in the EMiT tool.},

The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.},

@article{Mikolov2013b,
abstract = {The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

@article{Rong2014word2vec,
abstract = {The word2vec model and application by Mikolov et al. have attracted a great amount of attention in recent two years. The vector representations of words learned by word2vec models have been shown to carry semantic meanings and are useful in various NLP tasks. As an increasing number of researchers would like to experiment with word2vec or similar techniques, I notice that there lacks a material that comprehensively explains the parameter learning process of word embedding models in details, thus preventing researchers that are non-experts in neural networks from understanding the working mechanism of such models. This note provides detailed derivations and explanations of the parameter update equations of the word2vec models, including the original continuous bag-of-word (CBOW) and skip-gram (SG) models, as well as advanced optimization techniques, including hierarchical softmax and negative sampling. Intuitive interpretations of the gradient equations are also provided alongside mathematical derivations. In the appendix, a review on the basics of neuron networks and backpropagation is provided. I also created an interactive demo, wevi, to facilitate the intuitive understanding of the model.},

@article{HeuristicsMiner2006,
abstract = {The basic idea of process mining is to extract knowledge from event logs recorded by an information system. Until recently, the information in these event logs was rarely used to analyze the underly- ing processes. Process mining aims at improving this by providing tech- niques and tools for discovering process, organizational, social, and per- formance information from event logs. Fuelled by the omnipresence of event logs in transactional information systems (cf. WFM, ERP, CRM, SCM, and B2B systems), process mining has become a vivid research area 1, 2. In this paper we introduce the challenging process mining domain and discuss a heuristics driven process mining algorithm; the so-called HeuristicsMiner in detail. HeuristicsMiner is a practical ap- plicable mining algorithm that can deal with noise, and can be used to express the main behavior (i.e. not all details and exceptions) registered in an event log. In the experimental section of this paper we introduce benchmark material (12.000 different event logs) and measurements by which the performance of process mining algorithms can be measured.},

abstract = {Process discovery is the problem of, given a log of observed behaviour, finding a process model that ‘best' describes this behaviour. A large variety of process discovery algorithms has been proposed. How- ever, no existing algorithm guarantees to return a fitting model (i.e., able to reproduce all observed behaviour) that is sound (free of deadlocks and other anomalies) in finite time. We present an extensible framework to discover from any given log a set of block-structured process models that are sound and fit the observed behaviour. In addition we characterise the minimal information required in the log to rediscover a particular process model. We then provide a polynomial-time algorithm for discovering a sound, fitting, block-structured model from any given log; we give suffi- cient conditions on the log for which our algorithm returns a model that is language-equivalent to the process model underlying the log, including unseen behaviour. The technique is implemented in a prototypical tool.},

@inproceedings{InductiveVisualMiner2014,
abstract = {Process mining aims to extract information from recorded process data, which can be used to gain insights into the process. This requires applying a discovery algorithm and settings its parameters, after which the discovered process model should be evaluated. Both steps may need to be repeated several times until a satisfying model is found; we refer to this as process exploration. Existing commercial tools usually do not provide models having executable semantics, thereby disallowing for accurate map evaluation, while most academic tools lack features and by the repetitive nature of process exploration, their use is tedious. In this paper, we describe a novel process exploration tool: the Inductive visual Miner. It aims to bridge this gap between commercial and academic tools, by combining the executable semantics of academic tools with the exploration support of commercial tools. It also adds animation and deviation visualisation capabilities. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 for this paper by its authors. Copying permitted for private and academic purposes.},
