\section{Introduction}
Optimizing the management of business processes becomes more and more important. Companies often use a software package which helps with collecting, storing and managing data from such processes. This category of software is called ERP, which stands for Enterprise Resource Planning. An example of ERP-software is the software-package \textit{Profit}, provided by a Dutch IT-company AFAS Software BV. For our case study, we will use the historical workflow logging data of Profit, their current product. Our goal is to find interesting patterns in such data, which leads to a better understanding of what process (sub)structures represent the behavior in workflows the best.

A technology for engineering business processes is workflow management. Although a workflow does not actually have a clear definition, we use the term \textit{workflow} to refer to an organized set of \textit{tasks} to accomplish some business process \cite{Georgakopoulos1995}. The basic idea of a workflow model is to capture dependencies between process tasks in a graph. For instance, when the graph contains a relation $A \rightarrow B$, this means that task $A$ generally precedes task $B$ in an instance of this workflow. Thus, task $B$ cannot be executed until task $A$ is finished. Workflow modeling makes the intended behavior or so-called flow of a business process clear and can be used to steer such processes into the right direction.\\
The goal of \textit{workflow mining} is to revert this process, meaning that we try to find a suitable workflow based on a given set of execution logs of a business process.

\subsection{A simple example}
To make things more concrete, let us use a graph-like structure to represent a workflow. See Figure \ref{figure:example_workflow} for a simple example. The workflow shows the process of buying additional leave, and consists of a set of tasks and a set of actions. One task is the starting point - in this case \textit{Buying additional leave} - and one action is the ending point (the rightmost \textit{Accept}). For every task, I added which person needs to complete that task in order for the workflow to progress. (1) An employee fills in an application for buying additional leave, (2) his manager needs to approve the request and (3) the administrator also needs to approve this. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{figure:example_workflow}
\caption{Example workflow, representing the process of buying additional leave. Gray nodes are tasks, whereas blue nodes are actions. The dotted squares represent occurrences of the Approval pattern.}
\end{figure}

In case one of the two approvers does not agree with the request, the employee needs to adjust his request. Note that the action \textit{Resend} refers to the task \textit{Approve}. This means that this action leads to the task \textit{Approve} (another way to show this functionality would be to simply add an arrow from \textit{Resend} to the leftmost \textit{Approve}). Finally, the workflow is completed when the rightmost \textit{Accept} action is executed.\\
Besides tasks and actions, there are workflow patterns. According to \cite{Riehle1996}, a pattern \textit{“is the abstraction from a concrete form which keeps recurring in specific nonarbitrary contexts”}. In other words, a pattern is an abstraction of a concrete set of tasks of actions and is independent of the workflow language used. An example is the or-split workflow pattern, which is visible in Figure \ref{figure:example_workflow}. Since the task \textit{Approve} has two actions and you may only choose one, you can see this structure as an OR-split.\\
The problem we try to solve, is to find certain patterns within such a workflow. However, we look beyond the purely syntactic scope of patterns and try to include the semantics or contextual meaning of a pattern. To give an example, we can say that the workflow in Figure \ref{figure:example_workflow} contains a pattern which we call the \textit{Approval pattern} ("accordeer patroon" in Dutch). In short, this pattern exists of a task which represents the decision whether some change in the system gets accepted or not. As you can see, such a decision occurs two times in the workflow: the manager needs to approve the request and also the administrator needs to approve this (indicated as the dotted areas in Figure \ref{figure:example_workflow}). So when we try to find occurrences of the approving pattern, we would like to see these two parts of the workflow in the result of our query.

\subsection{Purpose of this study}
As a business company, you often can use workflows provided with your ERP-software package or create your own workflow. Provided workflow templates are in general workflows which represent very common business processes and most companies would like to use them. When you would like to have a workflow for a very specific process, you might have to assemble your own workflow structure. However, setting up such a workflow can become quite complex which can easily lead to errors in the model defined. Especially when you have to consider multiple different use cases.\\
To remove the burden of giving the user the option to define a workflow on such a low level by itself, we want to discover workflow patterns on a higher level. This way, we can abstract away from the low level representation of a workflow and use these high-level patterns to describe processes in an organization.\\
\\
In the eyes of an IT-company which develops and sells ERP-software, it is important to know which processes are most common in a company and what kind of steps are most important in workflows. Of course, having a good insight in the usage of workflows will be very helpful when you want to deliver a workflow management system. Getting a better understanding of the importance of a pattern in a workflow is the goal of this research project.

This problem basically consists of the following subproblems:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is a pattern?
\item When are two patterns equal?
\item When is a pattern frequent?
\item How can we mine occurrences of a pattern from a collection of logging data?
\end{enumerate}
We answer these subproblems formally in the next section.

\section{Preliminaries}
Let us state some basic definitions which we use throughout this thesis.
First of all, let us give a formal description of what a workflow (pattern) is.
\begin{defn}[Workflow]
A \textit{workflow W} is a set of tasks \textit{T} and corresponding actions $A$, set up to accomplish some business process.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Workflow Pattern]
A \textit{workflow pattern p} is a subset of a workflow $W$, i.e. $p \subset W, a_p \in A, t_p \in T$, such that this pattern represents a specific objective $O$.
\end{defn}
Recall the ``Approving pattern" from the example workflow in Figure \ref{figure:example_workflow}, which consists of the task \textit{Approve} and actions \{\textit{Accept, Reject}\}. The objective $O$ is in this case the \textit{approval} of something.

\begin{defn}[Workflow pattern similarity]
Two workflow patterns $p$ and $p'$ are said to be similar if they represent the same objective $O$. Thus, $p=p'$ i.f.f. $p \rightarrow O \wedge p' \rightarrow O$.
\end{defn}

\section{Problem}
The challenge which we undertake in this thesis, is to reason about interesting patterns in a given collection of workflow event logs. As a case study, we use the data of the current product of our case company AFAS Software BV. Before defining \textit{interesting} in our context, we want to know the behavior of workflows and hope to find patterns which represent this behavior the best. Note that we want to look further than the syntactic value of a pattern. We try to come up with a technique such that we can also mine patterns based on their semantics, which will give us a lot more information.\\
\\
During an iterative development, including meetings with domain experts of AFAS, we try to discover workflow patterns from which AFAS knows that they exist. However, the behavior of these workflow patterns are still unknown. Thus, by mining and analyzing occurrences of such patterns, we hope to find certain properties about these patterns. Drawing conclusions about such properties are being studied by the use of hypotheses testing. Which hypotheses will be tested, differs from the current pattern that we study. The meetings with domain experts at AFAS will be crucial for this phase.\\
\\
If the analysis of the patterns known by AFAS is completely finished, we will try to discover other patterns which are not known yet by AFAS.

% ANSWER THE QUESTIONS STATED IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION

\section{Literature Study}
This section refers to previous works, presenting theories and techniques around workflows, workflow patterns and the problem of mining such structures using workflow logs which are valuable for our research.\\

% Talk about process re-engineering in general and about workflows
Business process re-engineering is firstly proposed by \cite{Hammer1990} as an approach to tackle the problem of improving the quality of business processes, while reducing their cost. One of the earlier works presenting workflow management systems are \cite{EngelGLT79,Ellis1982}. The term \textit{information control net model} gets introduced by \cite{Ellis1982}, which can be seen as one of the earlier variants of workflow models. 

As I mentioned earlier, there are no real standards when it comes to the workflow paradigm \cite{VanderAalst1997}. This causes that management systems use different modeling languages, but a more important problem is the ability of verifying and analyzing workflows is often not available in such tools \cite{VanderAalst1997}. Because of this reason, \cite{VanderAalst1997} shows that a class of \textit{Petri nets} can be used as a way to represent workflows, which they call \textit{WF-nets}. Also, the correctness of WF-nets can be analyzed using the Petri net theory. 

% Talk about workflow patterns

The most common way to verify whether a workflow language is a good representation is by checking which \textit{workflow patterns} are covered by this language. A workflow pattern is described by \cite{Riehle1996} as \textit{``the abstraction from a concrete from which keeps recurring in specific nonarbitrary contexts"}, which holds that a pattern represents a certain functionality in a workflow while being dependent of the modeling language. Many \cite{VanderAalst2003Patterns,Dijkstra2003ControlPatterns,Russell2004DataPatterns,Russell2005ResourcePatterns,Russell2006ExceptionPatterns} describe workflow patterns providing functional requirements for workflow model languages. As stated in \cite{VanderAalst2003Patterns,Dijkstra2003ControlPatterns,Russell2004DataPatterns,Russell2005ResourcePatterns,Russell2006ExceptionPatterns}, a workflow pattern is defined by (1) a set of conditions which must be satisfied to be applicable, (2) examples of business situations where this pattern should be applied, (3) a problem description stating why applying this pattern is not trivial and (4) implementation solutions.

% Talk about workflow mining
Whereas the notion of process mining emerged within the last two decades \cite{VanderAalst2003}, the concept of workflow mining is first introduced by \cite{Agrawal1998}, where an algorithm is presented which has a set of unstructured executions of a business process as input, and outputs a minimal dependency graph representing the control flow of this business process. Furthermore, they discuss ways to cope with cycles in the graph and noise in event logs (missing executions of tasks or wrongly inserted tasks in a log). Others heuristic approaches for noise and incomplete logs are presented in \cite{Maruster2002,Weijters2001,Weijters}. The heuristic approach \cite{Weijters2001,Weijters} is a combination of the following steps: (1) constructing a dependency/frequency table, (2) mining basic dependency relations out of this table and (3) creating a workflow based on the relations found. Besides using these steps, \cite{Maruster2002} presents a logistic regression model to learn when two events are direct dependencies of one another. 

\cite{VanDerAalst2002} states that it is impossible to mine every possible WF-net. They name this challenge being the \textit{rediscovery problem}: \textit{``Find a mining algorithm able to rediscover a large class of sound WF-nets on the basis of complete workflow logs."}\cite{VanDerAalst2002}. An algorithm which can successfully mine a large class of WF-nets is the $\alpha$-algorithm \cite{VanderAalst2003,VanDerAalst2002,VanderAalst2002TimedLogs}, which assumes that the given workflow log is complete (this means that every possible execution path of the business process at hand must be present in the log). Although this completeness requirement is easy to satisfy for a simple workflow, larger workflows will have more trouble. For instance, a workflow having 10 tasks which can be executed in parallel results in $10!=3628800$ possible execution sequences. As you can tell, there is a rather small chance that every possible sequence is covered in a corresponding workflow log. Besides, the $\alpha$-algorithm did have issues with loops and self-loops. Multiple extensions on the $alpha$-algorithm have been developed. like \cite{A+-algorithm2004} which could deal with such short loops, and \cite{VanderAalst2002TimedLogs} which applies the algorithm on timed logs. Timestamps in such logs can be used to study the performance and bottlenecks of tasks in a process.\\

% Talk about event logging formats

% Talk about sequential pattern mining

% Talk about word2vec
When we search for research done on determining semantic meanings of words, we see that this field has attracted a lot attention in the last few years. Especially the word2vec model \cite{Mikolov2013a,Mikolov2013b} is a popular technique. This technique results in a vector space representation of words which carries semantic meanings and is very useful in natural language processing tasks. This technique is explained in further detail in Section \ref{section:word2vec}.

% Talk about workflow(pattern) mining tools
A widely used tool for process mining is ProM \cite{ProM6} (at the time of writing the latest ProM version is 6.7). This open-source, extensible framework has over 600 different plug-ins, including process mining algorithms like the $\alpha$-algorithm, who add their own functionality to the complete software package. ProM gives the user lots of possibilities when it comes down to mining event logs and the user interface helps with getting a good understanding of the structure of process models. In the article \cite{WorkflowMiner2006} are rules shown which describe the sequence- fork- and join workflow patterns. Furthermore, they made a plug-in for ProM 5.2 called ``Workflow pattern miner". 

\subsection{The word2vec model}
\label{section:word2vec}
The model is proposed in 2013 by \cite{Mikolov2013a,Mikolov2013b}. The earlier work of Mikolov et al. \cite{Mikolov2013a} explains the use of a continuous-bag-of-words model (CBOW). A bag-of-words model translates a given document as a bag of words. Since word2vec uses the notion of neural networks, let me explain this concept shortly. 

\subsubsection{Neural Networks}
An artificial neural network is based on a biological phenomenom, the human brain. Like a human brain, a neural network exists of neurons. Depending on the given information, i.e. input values, the neurons give a certain output. The most occurring output is eventually mostly likely the answer of your observation. In Figure \ref{figure:neuralnetwork}, you can see the model of a neural network with two input values $\{x_1,x_2\}$ (the input layer), two neurons $\{n_1, n_2\}$ (the hidden layer) and three output values $\{y_1,y_2,y_3\}$. As input of a neuon, the input values get weighted by $\{w_1,w_2,w_3,w_4\}$ and averaged:

\begin{equation}
u = \sum_{i=0}^{K}w_i x_i
\end{equation}

A neuron is eventually a function $f$, with input value $u$. In short, $f(u)$. The output of $f(u)$ is one of the possible output values. Recall the example network in Figure \ref{figure:neuralnetwork}, where $f(u)_{n_1} = $ $y_1$, $y_2$ or $y_3$. Quite obvious, the same counts for $f(u)_{n_2}$.

\section{Project Planning}
The first step in this case study is applying pre-processing steps on the available data. This means that we want the available workflow event data to be structured in such a way, that we can apply existing workflow mining algorithms on it to discover causal relations between tasks in a workflow. This phase not only consists of filtering noise or sorting/grouping the data in a certain way, but the challenge of determining which tasks or actions mean the same thing will also be tackled. Solving this problem is done by capturing the semantics of tasks and actions of a workflow. In order to achieve this, we will use the descriptions of tasks and actions. Using word2vec \cite{Mikolov2013a,Mikolov2013b}, we can represent such descriptions into a vector space model and compute the similarity between these descriptions. Based on a certain threshold value $\pi$, we determine when descriptions are said to be similar. The exact value of $\pi$ needs to be determined based on some different performance tests.
